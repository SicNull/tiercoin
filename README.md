Tiercoin Quark (TIER) is an open-source privacy focused digital
currency based on Bitcoins blockchain technology, Dash’ Masternodes
and Zerocoin’s Zerocash protocol, combining them to create a powerfully
innovative technology. Tiercoin Quark is also powered by Blackcoin
Proof-of-Stake 3.0 and Bitcoin core 0.10x code base using Quark
hashing algorithm with a block time of just 60 seconds.

A peer-to-peer digital currency that provides fast, zero cost payments to
anywhere around the world without any third-party intervention. Tiercoin
Quark is a fully decentralized global payment network allowing
individuals to have full control of their finances.

Masternodes require a collateral of 10,000 TIER and can be run on the
Tor network for greater privacy. All transactions on the network are fully
verifiable with a built-in blockchain explorer within the software itself. The
reward ratio of staking to masternodes is 30:70.
